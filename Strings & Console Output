# string
brian = "Hello life!"

# This code breaks because Python thinks the apostrophe in 'isn't' ends the string. 
# We can use the escape backslash to fix the problem
'This isn't flying, this is falling with style!'-->Wrong
'This isn\'t flying, this is falling with style!'-->Right

"""
The string "PYTHON" has six characters,
numbered 0 to 5, as shown below:

+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| P | Y | T | H | O | N |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0   1   2   3   4   5

So if you wanted "Y", you could just type
"PYTHON"[1] (always start counting from 0!)
