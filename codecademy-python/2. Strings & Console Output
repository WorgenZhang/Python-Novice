'This isn't flying, this is falling with style!'-->Wrong
'This isn\'t flying, this is falling with style!'-->Right

The string "PYTHON" has six characters,
numbered 0 to 5, as shown below:

+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| P | Y | T | H | O | N |

  0   1   2   3   4   5

So if you wanted "Y", you could just type
"PYTHON"[1] (always start counting from 0!)

The \ character on line 5 is a continuation marker. It simply tells Python that line 5 continues onto line 6.
